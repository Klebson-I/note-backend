Backend for notes application. Frontend is available on my profile also https://github.com/Klebson-I/note-frontend .
It should be run before frontend. I set running port on port 3001.
It applies mongodb database set in cloud (MongoDb Atlas).

To start install packages by : npm i
Then use start script or type in terminal : tsnd index.ts
